1. What do we mean when we say that MySQL has a client-server architecture?

MySQL clients (command-line "monitor", phpMyAdmin) connect to the server to perform database operations such as reading or storing data.

2. Use the monitor help to look up information on the SELECT statement. (Weâ€™ll discuss SELECT in detail in Chapter 5.)

mysql> help SELECT
Name: 'SELECT'
Description:
Syntax:
SELECT
    [ALL | DISTINCT | DISTINCTROW ]
      [HIGH_PRIORITY]
      [STRAIGHT_JOIN]
      [SQL_SMALL_RESULT] [SQL_BIG_RESULT] [SQL_BUFFER_RESULT]
      [SQL_CACHE | SQL_NO_CACHE] [SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS]
    select_expr, ...
    [FROM table_references
    [WHERE where_condition]
    [GROUP BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ... [WITH ROLLUP]]
    [HAVING where_condition]
    [ORDER BY {col_name | expr | position}
      [ASC | DESC], ...]
    [LIMIT {[offset,] row_count | row_count OFFSET offset}]
    [PROCEDURE procedure_name(argument_list)]
    [INTO OUTFILE 'file_name' export_options
      | INTO DUMPFILE 'file_name']
    [FOR UPDATE | LOCK IN SHARE MODE]]

SELECT is used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables, and can include UNION statements and subqueries. See [union], and
[subqueries].

The most commonly used clauses of SELECT statements are these:

o Each select_expr indicates a column that you want to retrieve. There must be at least one select_expr.

o table_references indicates the table or tables from which to retrieve rows. Its syntax is described in [join].

o The WHERE clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions that rows must satisfy to be selected. where_condition is an expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The statement selects all rows if there is no WHERE clause.

  In the WHERE clause, you can use any of the functions and operators that MySQL supports, except for aggregate (summary) functions. See [functions].

SELECT can also be used to retrieve rows computed without reference to any table.

3. What is the difference between using the monitor in interactive mode and using the monitor in batch mode?

- Interactive mode - you type SQL queries or MySQL commands at the prompt and view the results.

- Batch mode - you tell monitor to read and execute a list of commands from a file. Uses: to restore d.b. from backup; run a particular sequence of operations frequently.

4. What do the monitor user, password, and database options do?

- user option - allows you to connect to MySQL server with specific MySQL account name. Without username monitor will use your machine account name (default).

- password option - confirms that you have permission to access a specified database.

- database options - saves you typing another command USE dbatabase_name when connecting to MySQL server.
